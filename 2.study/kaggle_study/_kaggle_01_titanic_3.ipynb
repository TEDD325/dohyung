    "Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fail into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2 year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. "

    "<B>How-to Use this Tutorial:</b> Read the explanations provided in this Kernel and the links to developer documentation. The goal is to not just learn the whats, but the whys. If you don't understand something in the code the `print()` functions is your best friend. In coding, it's okay to try, fail, and try again. If you do run into problems, Google is your second best friend, because 99.99% of the time, someone else had the same question/problem and already asked the coding community. If you've exhausted all your resources, the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too."

    "It's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen(비전문가) terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For exmaple, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn(빠져나가다) or customer retention(유지). Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality(사망) rate or survival analysis. \n",

Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use(내가 가진 데이터셋과 그 결과물이 어떤 알고리즘을 사용할지를 알려준다.).
